# Ideation Workshop

I worked with Sailikhita, Sri Harsha and Rakesh for the ideation workshop. We met on Google Meet and used Ideaflip tool online for quick notes.


My idea for the project was to build a personal website that had all the information that a recruiter would like to know about me. In addition, I plan to implement a page where all my social updates can be posted.

For this project, I acted as a client, Harsha acted as a facilitator and Likhita and Rakesh acted as participants. The ideation meeting that we had was insightful and I  got good feedback on what I wanted to do for my final project. During the meeting, we went through the prescribed stages and I list below all the inputs in the corresponding heading. 

## Empathy Stage

Though I was the client, I am not typically the user of my personal website. It would be a recruiter or anyone interested in knowing me. When we empathize with the users, we decided that I should be prioritizing the information that is most needed. For example, a recruiter typically wants to know about all the technologies that I know and my experience with working in the industry. Hence we arrived at a decision of making that information readily available on the website.


## Define Stage

After the empathy stage, I gave them a plan of how I want to implement the plan of building my portfolio website. Here is the plan and requirements

- The website will have easy navigation between different sections
- The website will feature important sections for projects and technologies
- it will also have interactions to make the user experience better
- It will be responsive so that it will be accessible on the mobile devices
- No authentication or authorization will be needed as it should be public.
- Information on the website should be interlinked. For example, if I say I know React JS, when the user clicks on React Js, they see what projects I did in React JS. If they go to a project, it will show all the technologies that I used for that project. It works like how tags work.


## Ideation Stage

We used sticky notes for mind mapping but on a digital board to ideate. We wanted to keep it simple so each person had to write only the important piece of information that they would like to convey. Other information was orally discussed and everyone took notes on what they would want to improve. For my idea, I got a suggestion of adding interactivity to the website. But there are accessibility concerns, so the blend of the two with a balance would make it better. 

## Prototyping Stage

We have used multiple online examples to see how we want to build the website. Here are a few screenshots of how I plan to build the website.

## Feedback and Iteration

Based on the above images and prototypes, the participants suggested that some of the sections seem very dull because of the plain text and it can become boring as the recruiters typically go through a lot of such profiles and would want to see something unique. 


Overall, I have gained enough information for me to start building my website. It was an insightful meeting and the participant's feedback made it really valuable. I know this is not any technical contribution but it gave me a third-person point of view for my project plan. 


# My experience in other meetings.

I was a facilitator for Likhita's project and a participant for Harsha's and Rakesh's projects. 

Though I had experience as a Facilitator, this was a different environment and hence different learning. I tried to be neutral and tried to summarize the participant's views and make the requirements clear for the client. Breaking down the requirements and defining the scope such that the project is doable in the timeline.

For Rakesh's and Harsha's projects, I gave my ideas to make the application look better and more responsive. 

Overall this workshop was a very useful one and gave me a great experience.
